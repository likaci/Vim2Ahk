               :FencView                                           
                   Open the encoding list window,                  
                   <up> and <down> to select an encoding,          
                   enter to reload the file                        
              Menu:                                                
                Select a file encoding from the                    
                Tools->Encoding menu just like what you do in      
                firefox/IE.                                        
              Options:                                             
                Set these value in vimrc to config this            
                plugin. Expmple:                                   
                let g:fencview_autodetect = 1                      
                                                                   
                "$FENCVIEW_TELLENC"                                
                  Now FencView allows the use of an external       
                  program to determine the file encoding. It       
                  may give you better performance, or better       
                  accuracy, in some cases. Set the environment     
                  variable FENCVIEW_TELLENC (or the vimrc          
                  variable $FENCVIEW_TELLENC) to use this          
                  feature. It is currently tested against          
                  tellenc.                                         
                  (default: 'tellenc')                             
                  It means if tellenc is executable, it will       
                  be used by default. If you still want to use     
                  the detection mechanism of this script, set      
                  the value to "fencview".                         
                                                                   
                "g:fencview_autodetect"                            
                  Auto detect file encoding when you open a        
                  file.                                            
                  (default: 1)                                     
                                                                   
                "g:fencview_auto_patterns"                         
                  Set this variable in your vimrc to decide        
                  the pattern of file names to enable              
                  autodetection.                                   
                  (default: '*.txt,*.htm{l\=}')                    
                                                                   
                "g:fencview_checklines"                            
                  It checks first and last several lines of        
                  current file, so don't set the value too         
                  large.                                           
                  (default: 10)                                    
                                                                   
Tip:          1 "+iconv" feature is needed. If you are             
                using Microsoft Windows, make sure you             
                have iconv.dll in $PATH.                           
                (http://mbbill.googlepages.com/iconv.dll)          
                Use command ":echo has('iconv')" to check it.      
              2 Make sure there is no modeline at the end of       
                current file.                                      
              3 set encoding to utf-8 for better performance.      
              4 No effect to Vim encrypted files.
